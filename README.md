SQL Practice Project: Key Operations

This project provides hands-on practice with essential SQL operations:

Creating Tables:
Participants will design and create relational database tables using SQL's Data Definition Language (DDL). They will define table structures, specify data types, and set primary and foreign key constraints.

Inserting Data:
Participants will populate the created tables with sample data using SQL's INSERT statement. This step allows for the practical application of database operations and validates the database design.

Selecting Data:
Participants will write SQL queries using the SELECT statement to retrieve data from the database tables. They will learn to filter, sort, and aggregate data to extract meaningful information.

Updating Data:
Through SQL's UPDATE statement, participants will modify existing data in the tables. This operation is essential for maintaining data accuracy and making necessary changes to records.

Deleting Data:
Participants will use SQL's DELETE statement to remove unwanted data from the tables. This operation helps manage database size and ensure data cleanliness.

Altering Tables:
Participants will learn to alter the structure of existing database tables using SQL's ALTER TABLE statement. They can add or drop columns, modify constraints, and make other changes to adapt to evolving requirements.

Grouping and Aggregating Data:
Participants will practice SQL's GROUP BY clause and aggregate functions (such as SUM, AVG, COUNT) to group data and perform calculations on grouped results. This enables the generation of summary reports and statistical analyses.

Joining Tables:
Participants will master SQL's JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables based on specified relationships. They will understand different types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) and their applications in querying related data.

By engaging in these key SQL operations, participants will develop a strong foundation in database querying, manipulation, and management, essential for various roles in data management, analytics, and software development.
